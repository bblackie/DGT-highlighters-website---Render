Set up your working folders.

    1. Start by creating a 'repos' folder at the root of your C: drive to avoid an file path limits (255 chars in Windows!) and conflicts with OenDrive.
    
    2. Next create a folder for your DGT projects called '11DGT' 
    
    3. Finally,  create a folder for your project called 'flask-demo' and open it in VS Code.

Now, you need to create a virtual environment.

Open a terminal and type.
```
python -m venv .venv
```
This creates a .venv folder inside the project. That folder contains a separate Python environment for this project.

Next, you activate it.

On Windows PowerShell:

.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

If the prompt changes to include (.venv), that is evidence that the environment is active.

NB: You might get an error here regarding running PowerShell scripts.  To resolve that run:
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser

Then you upgrade pip:

python -m pip install --upgrade pip

This matters because pip is the tool that installs Python packages. Using python -m pip is clearer than just typing pip, because it makes sure the package installer belongs to the currently selected Python interpreter.

Example package install

If the project later needs a package such as requests, you would install it like this:

python -m pip install flask


## OPTION B: using a requirements file

To install all dependencies frOm a requirements file, if provided
NB: If you don't have a requirements file, see 'Extra tasks' below for how to create one
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### How to create one?

pip freeze > requirements.txt


Your first flask app
